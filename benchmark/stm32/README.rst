bitproto benchmark on STM32
===========================

This directory contains a simple benchmark for bitproto encoding and decoding on STM32.

The project `bpbench <bpbench>`_ is based on code generated by
`stm32cubemx <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html>`_,
, tested on microcontrollers: `stm32f103zet6 <https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f103ze.html>`_
and `stm32f103ve6 <https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f103ve.html>`_.
